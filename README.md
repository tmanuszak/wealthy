# Notes
- Tailwind color scheme:
  - Found this terminal color scheme as inspiration: https://github.com/Gogh-Co/Gogh/blob/master/themes/Everforest%20Light%20Hard.yml
  - I like the background and foreground, as well as the green, red, and "white". 
  - Take the above hex colors and turn them into oklch using this tool: https://oklch.com/
  - Take the oklch value and turn it into a tailwind color palette with this tool: https://tailwindcss-oklch-color-palette-generator.vercel.app/
- TODO: 
  - Find green and red success/failure colors

  Maybe a desktop app using tauri?

  Name change: feyenance.app
  Use this logo: https://icones.js.org/collection/all?s=eye&icon=game-icons:eyeball
